It covers a broad range of topics including design, architecture, culture, the economy, politics and philosophy. Owned by Conday Nast Publications, it is published in London and is an offshoot of the original American Wired.\n\nContents \n1 History\n1.1 Current version (2009-present)\n1.2 Earlier version (mid-1990s)\n2 Wired Conference\n3 References\n4 External links\nHistory\nCurrent version (2009-present)\nThe current version of the magazine was launched in April 2009, and was the second international version of Wired, after the launch of Wired Italia in March 2009. In November 2009, the British Society of Magazine Editors awarded Launch of the Year to Wired editor David Rowan. Nate Lanxon (formerly of CNET UK) took over position of editor for Wired.co.uk in January 2010.\n\nEarlier version (mid-1990s)\n\nCover of the April 1995 launch issue.\nThe magazine's current incarnation follows an earlier attempt at a British edition of Wired[2] which ran from April 1995[3] until March 1997.[4] It was initially created as a joint venture with the Guardian Media Group[5] and Wired US.'.s then owners, Wired Ventures, but that incarnation lasted only three[6] or four[7] issues, due to a culture clash between the two parties[2][5] and low sales figures of 25,000 per month.[6] Wired Ventures then ran the UK edition alone, with an almost entirely new staff,[8] until the magazine was closed with the March 1997 issue, when sales were at 40,000 magazines per month.[6]\n\nWired Conference\nWired UK, together with Telefonica, held a two-day event on 25-26 October 2012 at The Brewery in London. The conference was designed to \"explore the ideas, innovations and people that are reshaping our world\".[9] Among its speakers were David Karp, founder of microblogging platform Tumblr, and Mona Eltahawy, an Egyptian-American freelance journalist and commentator.\n\nWired 2011, hosted between 13-14 October at the St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel, included guest speakers Joanna Shields, Managing Director and Vice President of Facebook EMEA, and Gil Hirsch, founder of Face.com.[10]","repeatDelay":3000,"actions":{"9":"start"},"url":"/assets/info.mp3","id":"info"},"message":{"text":"Start recording your message by pressing 1.
